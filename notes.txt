redux
- state management library for js apps
- can use any library

- we need to keep different parts of ui in sync 
- solution
    - store all apps states inside a central repository called the store
    - ui no longer maintain their own state 
    - they get it from store 
- makes it easier to see how the data changes in our application 
- makes data flow transparent and predictable
